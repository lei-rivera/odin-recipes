        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Sinigang is a Filipino soup cooked with pork. Serve with rice and for additional sauce, use soy or fish
            sauce. If you want to, you can add what Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled
            they look like potatoes. You can add five to six of them when you add the water and make sure they are
            cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked because they can get too soft.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are different variations of sinigang used with different types of meat, such as pampano or salmon
            for a fish sinigang. Pork sinigang happens to be, not just my favorite kind of sinigang but my favorite
            dish period.
