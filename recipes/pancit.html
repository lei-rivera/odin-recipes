        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            Pancit is a Filipino dish. There are many different types of pancit, but it always features rice noodles and
            vegetables (and often meat, such as pork or chicken).
        </p>

        <p>
            Pancit is traditionally made with vermicelli rice noodles. The great thing about rice noodles? You don't
            have to boil them! Just soften them in water and you're good to go. If you don't have rice noodles on hand,
            you can use udon or chow mein noodles.
        </p>
