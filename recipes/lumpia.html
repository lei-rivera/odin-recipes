        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This is a traditional Filipino recipe for fried lumpia, or spring rolls. They're made with paper-thin lumpia
            wrappers and filled with a savory mixture of ground pork, cabbage, and other vegetables. Serve lumpia as a
            side dish or appetizer with a sweet chili dipping sauce.
        </p>

        <p>
            Lumpia are fresh or fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and Indonesian cuisines. The rolls traditionally
            feature a thin pastry skin (a.k.a. a lumpia wrapper) and are often stuffed with a savory mixture of ground
            pork and vegetables.
