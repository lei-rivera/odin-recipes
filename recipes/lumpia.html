        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            This is a traditional Filipino recipe for fried lumpia, or spring rolls. They're made with paper-thin lumpia
            wrappers and filled with a savory mixture of ground pork, cabbage, and other vegetables. Serve lumpia as a
            side dish or appetizer with a sweet chili dipping sauce.

        <p>
            Lumpia are fresh or fried spring rolls that are found in Filipino and Indonesian cuisines. The rolls traditionally
            feature a thin pastry skin (a.k.a. a lumpia wrapper) and are often stuffed with a savory mixture of ground
            pork and vegetables.

            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Add pork; cook and stir until crumbly and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove pork from the pan and set aside. Drain grease from the pan, leaving just a thin coating.

            <li>
                To assemble lumpia: Place 3 heaping tablespoons of filling diagonally near one corner of a lumpia wrapper, leaving a 1 Â½ inch space at both ends.

            <li>
                Fold the side along the length of the filling over the filling, tuck in both ends, and roll neatly and tightly to close.

            <li>
                Moisten the other side of the wrapper with water to seal the edge. Transfer to a plate and cover with plastic wrap to retain moisture. Repeat to assemble remaining lumpia.

            <li>
                Slide 3 to 4 lumpia into the hot oil, making sure the seams are facing down. Fry, turning occasionally, until all sides are golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat to fry remaining lumpia.
